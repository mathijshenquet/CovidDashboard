A short-term modelling project of the corona epidemic from march 2020 until june 2020. It used public datasources, mainly worldometer and ECDC, to publish daily report cards for various regions. 

Some example output is below, the full output can be found in the telegram channel https://t.me/mthq_covid_dashboard
